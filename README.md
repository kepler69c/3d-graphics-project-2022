# 3d-graphics-project-2022

This project has for objective to create a Heroic Fantastic Land with OpenGL.

He's create by Alexandre Berard, Thibault Groot and Margot Duran.

# Features:

 - Desert with some dunes created by value noise
 - Moving dragon and wing's dragon. He make a cercle in the sky and he flaps its wings. The size of the cercle can change if we press the arrows on the keyboard
 - Light with some warm color
 - Skybox with a gradient from blue to white, the white being at the level of the horizon
 - Sandstorm
 - Sun

# Difficulties, possible extensions:

 - Create sphere to represent some tumble weed with a texture. We failed to create a sphere. But with a working program, it would have been interesting to roll it along the dunes
